    United States Declaration of Independence
    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    The United States Declaration of Independence is the statement
    adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State
    House (Independence Hall) in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which announced
    that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with the Kingdom of Great
    Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer
    under British rule. These states would found a new nation – the United States of
    America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was passed
    on July 2 with no opposing vote cast. A committee of five had already drafted the
    formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence.

    John Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original
    draft of the document, which Congress would edit to produce the final version.
    The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July
    2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of
    the American Revolutionary War. The next day, Adams wrote to his wife Abigail: "The
    Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America."
    But Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the Declaration of
    Independence was approved.

    After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in
    several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely
    distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost,
    and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand.[5] Jefferson's original draft, complete
    with changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, and Jefferson's notes of changes made
    by Congress, are preserved at the Library of Congress. The best-known version of the Declaration
    is a signed copy that is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and which is
    popularly regarded as the official document. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on
    July 19 and signed primarily on August 2.

    The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry.
    The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against
    King George III, and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution.
    Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, references to the text of the
    Declaration were few in the following years. Abraham Lincoln made it the centerpiece of his rhetoric
    (as in the Gettysburg Address of 1863) and his policies. Since then, it has become a well-known statement
    on human rights, particularly its second sentence:

    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
    Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

    This has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language", containing "the most potent
    and consequential words in American history". The passage came to represent a moral standard to which
    the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln, who considered the
    Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles
    through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.

    The U.S. Declaration of Independence inspired many other similar documents in other countries, the first
    being the 1789 Declaration of Flanders issued during the Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands
    (modern-day Belgium). It also served as the primary model for numerous declarations of independence across
    Europe and Latin America, as well as Africa (Liberia) and Oceania (New Zealand) during the first half of the
    19th century.

 Exercise: 017
---------------

Write a Python program to get all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length n.
A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the same when rotated
180 degrees. In other words, the numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down (e.g., 69, 96, 1001).

For example,
Given n = 2, return "11", "69", "88", "96".
Given n = 3, return '818', '111', '916', '619', '808', '101', '906', '609', '888', '181', '986', '689'
Given n = 3, return 8008 1001 9006 6009 8888 1881 9886 6889 8118 1111 9116 6119 8968 1961 9966 6969 8698 1691 9696 6699

When generating a strobogrammatic number, we are interested in filling in the first and last digits, which are paired.
The only pairs of digits that form valid strobogrammatic numbers are:

("1", "1")
("6", "9")
("9", "6")
("8", "8")
("0", "0") (but only in the middle of the number, because a number can't start with 0 unless it's "0" itself).

 Exercise: 027
---------------

Write a Python program to find the type of the progression (arithmetic progression / geometric progression) and
the next successive member of the three successive members of a sequence.

According to Wikipedia, an arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any
two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ... is an
arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression
whose common difference is a non-zero integer.

On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by
multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18,
54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric
progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer.

    [1, 2, 3]       =>  4
    [2, 6, 18]      =>  54.0
    [0, 0, 0]       =>  Wrong Numbers (neither AP nor GP)

 Exercise: 028
---------------

Write a Python program to print the length of the series and the series from the given 3rd term, 3rd last term and
the sum of an arithmetic progression series.

In AP, we will come across some main terms, which are denoted as:
    First term (a)
    Common difference (d)
    nth Term (an)
    Sum of the first n terms (Sn)

a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, ………. ,a + (n – 1) d

d = a2 – a1 = a3 – a2 = ……. = an – an – 1

nth Term of an AP = an = a + (n − 1) × d

sum of the first n terms: Sn = n/2[2a + (n − 1) × d]

Sum of AP when the Last Term is Given: S  = n/2 (first term + last term)

Solution:
---------
Third term =        a + 2d = k1, say (k1 is known)
Third last term =   a + (n-3)d = k2 (k2 is known)
Sum of the AP =     n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]
Alright, so now we have the equations. Let's add the first two equations.
2a + (n-1)d = k1 + k2
Putting this in the formula for sum of terms, S = n/2(k1+k2).
Hence, n = 2S/(k1+k2)
Now subtract the first equation from the second.
(n-5)d = k2 - k1. Since you know n, you can find d.
And now since you know the value of d, substitute it in the first equation to find a, the first term.

Sample Data:
    Input third term of the series: 3
    Input 3rd last term: 3
    Input Sum of the series: 15

Length of the series: 5
Series: 1 2 3 4 5

Sample Data:
    Input third term of the series: 3

Write a Python program that reads the two adjoining sides and the diagonal of a parallelogram and checks whether
the parallelogram is a rectangle or a rhombus.

According to Wikipedia-
parallelograms: In Euclidean geometry, a parallelogram is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral with two
pairs of parallel sides. The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles
of a parallelogram are of equal measure.

rectangles: In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. It can also be defined
as an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360°/4 = 90°). It can also
be defined as a parallelogram containing a right angle.

rhombus: In plane Euclidean geometry, a rhombus (plural rhombi or rhombuses) is a simple (non-self-intersecting)
quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral
means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus is often called a diamond, after the diamonds suit in
playing cards which resembles the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes
refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60° angle, and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with
a 45° angle.

Input:
Two adjoined sides and the diagonal.
1 <= ai, bi, ci <= 1000, ai + bi > ci
Input two adjoined sides and the diagonal of a parallelogram (comma separated): 3,4,5
                                                                                This is a rectangle.

Write a Python program which accepts an even number (>=4, Goldbach number) from the user and creates combinations
which express the given number as a sum of two prime numbers. Print the number of combinations.

Goldbach number: A Goldbach number is a positive even integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.
Since four is the only even number greater than two that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the sum
of two primes, another form of the statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all even integers greater than 4 are
Goldbach numbers.

The expression of a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach partition of that number.
The following are examples of Goldbach partitions for some even numbers:
6 = 3 + 3
8 = 3 + 5
10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5
12 = 7 + 5

If you draw a straight line on a plane, the plane is divided into two regions. For example, if you draw two straight
lines in parallel, you get three areas, and if you draw vertically one to the other you get 4 areas.

Write a Python program to create the maximum number of regions obtained by drawing n given non-parallel straight lines.
Input:
(1 <= n <= 10,000)
Input number of straight lines (o to exit):     5
Number of regions:                              16

One line can divide a plane into two regions, two non-parallel lines can divide a plane into 4 regions and three
non-parallel lines can divide into 7 regions, and so on

L(2) – L(1) = 2 … (i)
L(3) – L(2) = 3 … (ii)
L(4) – L(3) = 4 … (iii)

In mathematics, a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements
without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence (A,B,D) is a subsequence of
(A,B,C,D,E,F) obtained after removal of elements C, E, and F. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of
another is a preorder.

The subsequence should not be confused with substring (A,B,C,D) which can be derived from the above string
(A,B,C,D,E,F) by deleting substring (E,F). The substring is a refinement of the subsequence.
The list of all subsequences for the word "apple" would be "a", "ap", "al", "ae", "app", "apl", "ape", "ale", "appl",
"appe", "aple", "apple", "p", "pp", "pl", "pe", "ppl", "ppe", "ple", "pple", "l", "le", "e", "".

From Wikipedia:
An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a logological term for a word or phrase without a repeating letter.
It is also used by some people to mean a word or phrase in which each letter appears the same number of times, not
necessarily just once. Conveniently, the word itself is an isogram in both senses of the word, making it autological.

Write a Python program to check whether a given string is an "isogram" or not.

Write a Python program to check whether a given number is a narcissistic number or not.

If you are a reader of Greek mythology, then you are probably familiar with Narcissus. He was a hunter of exceptional
beauty that he died because he was unable to leave a pool after falling in love with his own reflection. That's why I
keep myself away from pools these days (kidding).

In mathematics, he has kins by the name of narcissistic numbers - numbers that can't get enough of themselves.
In particular, they are numbers that are the sum of their digits when raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example, 371 is a narcissistic number; it has three digits, and if we cube each digits 33 + 73 + 13 the sum is 371.

Other 3-digit narcissistic numbers are
153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3
370 = 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3
407 = 4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3.

There are also 4-digit narcissistic numbers, some of which are 1634, 8208, 9474 since
1634 = 1^4+6^4+3^4+4^4
8208 = 8^4+2^4+0^4+8^4
9474 = 9^4+4^4+7^4+4^4

It has been proven that there are only 88 narcissistic numbers (in the decimal system) and that the largest of which is
115,132,219,018,763,992,565,095,597,973,971,522,401; has 39 digits.

Sample Input:

(407)   =>  True
(409)   =>  False
(1634)  =>  True

 Exercise: 135
---------------

Write a Python program that calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of more than two numbers. The numbers should be
taken from a given list of positive integers.
From Wikipedia,
In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two
integers a and b, usually denoted by lcm(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.
Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if a and b are both different from
zero. However, some authors define lcm(a,0) as 0 for all a, which is the result of taking the lcm to be the least
upper bound in the lattice of divisibility.

Original list elements: [4, 6, 8]                           =>  24
Original list elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]     =>  2520

 Exercise: 141
---------------

Write a Python program to get the domain name using PTR DNS records from a given IP address.

What is a DNS PTR record?

The Domain Name System, or DNS, correlates domain names with IP addresses. A DNS pointer record (PTR for short) provides
 the domain name associated with an IP address. A DNS PTR record is exactly the opposite of the 'A' record, which
 provides the IP address associated with a domain name.

DNS PTR records are used in reverse DNS lookups. When a user attempts to reach a domain name in their browser, a DNS
lookup occurs, matching the domain name to the IP address. A reverse DNS lookup is the opposite of this process: it is
a query that starts with the IP address and looks up the domain name. Source: cloudflare.com

print(get_domain_name("8.8.8.8"))           =>  dns.google
print(get_domain_name("13.251.106.90"))     =>  ec2-13-251-106-90.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
