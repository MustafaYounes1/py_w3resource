Write a Python program to sort unsorted numbers using Binary Insertion Sort.

Binary insertion sort is a sorting algorithm which is similar to the insertion sort, but instead of using linear search
to find the location where an element should be inserted, we use binary search. Thus, we reduce the comparative value
of inserting a single element from O(n) to O(log n).

It is a flexible algorithm, which means it works faster when the same given members are already heavily sorted, i.e.,
the current location of the feature is closer to its actual location in the sorted list.

It is a stable sorting algorithm â€“ elements with the same values appear in the same sequence in the last order as they
were in the first list.

========
Approach
========

* Iterate the array from the second element to the last element.
* Store the current element "A[i]" in a variable "key".
* Find the position of the element just greater than "A[i]" in the subarray from "A[0]" to "A[i-1]" using binary search.
  Say this element is at index "pos".
* Shift all the elements from index "pos" to "i-1" towards the right.
* "A[pos] = key"

Worst / Average Time Complexity:    O(n^2)
Best Time Complexity:               O(n * log(n)) (the num of comparisons for inserting one element is O(log n),
                                    and for N elements, it will be O(n log n).)

[14, 46, 43, 27, 57, 41, 45, 21, 70]

Ascending order:    [14, 21, 27, 41, 43, 45, 46, 57, 70]
Descending order:   [70, 57, 46, 45, 43, 41, 27, 21, 14]
